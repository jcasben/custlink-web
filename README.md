## What I've learned

During this project I learned lot of things about how web applications work and I also added new technologies to my stack.

### 🔌 Connecting frontend to backend

- One of my main objectives for this project was learning the proper way of connecting the frontend of and application with its backend. 
In my opinion, this is not a very hard skill, but it's a very important one because it gives you a lot more options for making your project
even better.

### 🔐 User login using JWT

- A key feature of all web application is being able to create an account. I accomplished this using JSON Web Tokens (JWT) provided by my API
and storing them locally. This token is used as a header for all the operations of the API that require authentication.

### 🅰️ Picking up Angular

- I have been wanting to learn Angular for some time and this project was the perfect moment to give it a try.
For what I've seen at the moment, seems a very good option for the kind of projects I want to develop.
